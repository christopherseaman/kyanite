We are porting an MVP of Cline to work as an Obsidian plugin. The plan is in @/PLAN.md with step-by-step breakdown in @/IMPLEMENTATION.md . Cline source is in @/cline/  , sample obsidian plugin in @/obsidian-sample-plugin/  , and an inspiration plugin-in @/obsidian-bmo-chatbot/ . Please review the @/PLAN.md and @/IMPLEMENTATION.md and make edits for feasibility. I believe that getting BRAT working should be first and is documented in @/_WORKING_BRAT_.md with a utility script @/version-bump.mjs . Then logging so local and plugin output the same (console log local, vault root /kyanite-debug.md for plugin). Then  basic API ( API_KEY set in .env locally and in a settings page in plugin). What do you think? Please edit the plan and implementation to reflect something that cline could attempt step by step. Test for each piece built, that testing should be checked before every release
